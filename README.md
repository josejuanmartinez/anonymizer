# Hybrid Neural-Regexp Anonymizer of entities
## Neural model
Uses Flair 0.8 to anonymize:
- PER
- DATE
- GPE
- LOC
- TIME

NOTE: These entities have a ~0.9 of both recall and accuracy.

## Regex model
Uses different regular expressions to manage other kind of (Spanish so far) entities, as:
- Phone numbers
- Emails
- NIE/NIF
- Social Id's
- Passports
...
  
NOTE: These entities have a LOW recall, since they are very document dependant. You must need to include new or fine-tune them.
To do that, use `esentities.py` or create another file for another language (`enentities.py`, ...)

## IMAGE BUILD TO UPLOAD TO DOCKER HUB
Just go to ./docker and execute:
`sudo docker-compose build`

This will create an image. 

To upload it to docker hub:

`sudo docker push docker.io/josejuanmartineziqvia/anonymizer:0.1`


## INSTALLATION

## Apertium (for translation)
### From docker hub

# Installation

First, pull the image from this repository:

`sudo docker pull docker.io/josejuanmartineziqvia/apertium`

Then, run the container:

`sudo docker run -d --name apertium -p "2737:2737" docker.io/josejuanmartineziqvia/apertium`

# Request
To check that apertium is up and running you can:

1) Use browser, just typing the following url, replacing SERVER_IP with your server ip value:
    `> http://{SERVER_IP}:2737/translate?langpair=cat|spa&q=Bon%20dia`

2) Using command line, in the same server where docker is running:

    `> wget "http://0.0.0.0:2737/translate?langpair=cat|spa&q=Bon%20dia" -O response.txt`

    `> cat response.txt`

# Response

`{"responseData": {"translatedText": "Buenos dÃ­as"}, "responseDetails": null, "responseStatus": 200}`

## DOCKER INSTALLATION
### From docker hub

### Install apertium first 

First, install and run Apertium [here](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/josejuanmartineziqvia/apertium)

### Install anonymizer

#### Pull the anonymizer image

`sudo docker pull docker.io/josejuanmartineziqvia/anonymizer:0.1`

#### Create a folder to store PDF files
`sudo mkdir anonymizer_docs`

`cd anonymizer_docs`

#### Create two folders: input (for original PDF to anonymizer) and output (to get the results)
`sudo mkdir input output`

#### Finally, instantiate a container using the image setting the input and output folders and connecting it to Apertium translation engine

From `anonymizer_docs` folder, where you should have `./input` and `./output` folders already created in previous steps, execute:

`sudo docker run -d --name anonymizer -p "9090:9090" --link "apertium" --expose "2737" -v "${PWD}/input:/opt/anonymizer/input" -v "${PWD}/output:/opt/anonymizer/output" docker.io/josejuanmartineziqvia/anonymizer:0.1`

### EXECUTION OF ANONYMIZATION

#### Preparing PDF files 

Being in `anonymizer_docs` folder created before:

`sudo cp [path_to_example_pdf].pdf ./input/`

Copy all the pdfs you need to anonymize.

#### Request

You can launch the anonymization using a HTTP request, for example:

1) From your browser:

`> http://[SERVER_IP]:9090/anonymizer/pdf/extract/translate/anonymize/bulk?from_lang=cat&to_lang=spa&host=http://apertium&port=2737`

2) Using wget;

`> wget "http://localhost:9090/anonymizer/pdf/extract/translate/anonymize/bulk?from_lang=cat&to_lang=spa&host=http://apertium&port=2737" -O response.txt`

`> cat response.txt`

IMPORTANT: First time it will take a while, since it will download several language models, some of the of about 1GB. But it's only the first time. To see the progress:

`sudo docker logs -f anonymizer`

#### Response
You should see either in the browser or in response.txt, the following:

`{'status': 'OK'}`

... that will mean that the process has successfully finished and you have the anonymized .txt results in `output` folder.

## DOCKER_COMPOSE INSTALLATION
### From source code
In `./`

`sudo docker-compose up -d`

This will take the docker-compose.yaml in the root folder and download the model from docker hub

### Construction mode
In `./docker/`

`sudo docker-compose up -d`

This will build and tag the docker image locally
